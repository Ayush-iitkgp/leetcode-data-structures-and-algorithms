# Hashing

* Hashing allows to reduce the time complexity of a problem by O(n).
* In Python, we use dictionary to implement hashing.
* A Hash Map, can insert and delete a key in O(1).
* It can also update the value of a key in O(1).
* It can also check for the existence of a key in O(1).

**Important:**
**Checking for an existence in a set is also O(1). Basically, a set has similar properties as a Hash Map**

## Limitations of Hashing


## Use Cases of Hashing
### 1. Checking for existence:
One of the most common applications of a hash table or set is determining if an element exists in O(1). Usually,
the problem would be solved in O(n^2) but with hashing we can solve it in O(n)

### 2. Counting
