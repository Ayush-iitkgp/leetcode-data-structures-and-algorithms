# LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course

This repository contains notes and examples for the LeetCode [Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/).

## Data Structures
### Arrays and strings
#### 1. Two Pointers Approach:
   * Solve an array problem in O(n) time complexity.
#### 2. Sliding Window Approach
   * Solve finding a valid (longest/smallest) subarray/substring in O(n) time complexity.
   * Also, find number of valid sub-arrays.
#### 3. Prefix Sum
   * Only used for array of numbers(int/float).
   * Used when the problem involves **sum of sub-arrays**.

**Important Tip:** Substring or sub-array problems are usually solved using Sliding Window but subsequence
problems are usually solved into Dynamic Programming.

### Hashing
#### 1. Checking for the existence
   * Anytime you find your algorithm running `if ... in ...`, use hash map or set
#### 2. Counting/Frequency
   * Anytime you want to count something think of a hash map or a set.
   * Find the number of sub-arrays with an **exact** constraint.

### Linked lists
#### 1. Fast and Slow Pointers
   * Find the middle of the linked list given it has odd number of elements
   * Find if a linked list has a cycle
   * Given the head of a linked list and an integer k, return the `kth` node from the end.
#### 2. Reverse a linked list
   * Reverse a linked list
   * Swap nodes in pairs

### Stacks and queues

### Trees and Graphs
#### Binary Tree

##### 1. Depth First Search
   * Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree
   * Path Sum
   * vdv
   * vsdvsd

##### 2. Breadth First Search

##### 3. Binary Search Tree


## Algorithms

### Greedy

### Binary Search

### Backtracking

### Dynamic Programming
1. **Optimal (max/longest or min/shortest) way of doing something**
2. Number of ways of doing something
3. The most tricky part of DP is defining the recurrence relation for the problem.
