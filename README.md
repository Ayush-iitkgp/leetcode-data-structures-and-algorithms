# LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course

This repository contains notes and examples for the LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course.

## Data Structure
### Arrays and strings
1. **Two pointers Approach:**
   * Solve an array problem in O(n) time complexity.
2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   * Solve finding a valid (longest/smallest) subarray/substring in O(n) time complexity.
   * Also, find number of valid sub-arrays.
3. **Prefix Sum:**
   * Only used for array of numbers(int/float).
   * Used when the problem involves **sum of sub-arrays**.

**Important Tip:** Substring or sub-array problems are usually solved using Sliding Window but subsequence
problems are usually solved into Dynamic Programming.

### Hashing
1. **Checking for the existence:**
   * Anytime you find your algorithm running `if ... in ...`, use hash map or set
2. **Counting/Frequency:**
   * Anytime you want to count something think of a hash map or a set.


### Stacks and queues


## Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
1. **Optimal (max/longest or min/shortest) way of doing something
2. Number of ways of doing something
3. The most tricky part of DP is defining the recurrence relation for the problem.
