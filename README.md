# LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course

This repository contains notes and examples for the LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course.

## Data Structure
### Arrays and strings
1. **Two pointers Approach:** Solve an array problem in O(n) time complexity.
2. **Sliding Window Approach:** Solve finding a valid (longest/smallest) subarray/substring in O(n) time complexity. Also, find number of valid sub-arrays.
3. **Prefix Sum:** Only used for array of numbers(int/float). Used when the problem involves **sum of sub-arrays**.

**Important Tip:**

### Hashing
1. **Checking for the existence:** Anytime you find your algorithm running `if ... in ...`, use hash map or set
2. **Counting/Frequency:** Anytime you want to count something think of a hash map or a set.


### Stacks and queues


## Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
